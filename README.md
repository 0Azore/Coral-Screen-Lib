# Coral-Screen-Lib
Library used to communicate between adafruit pin-out screen and google coral board.

The directory included is the found in /usr/local of the google coral board. To implement into an existing system it would be advized to rip just the components you would like from the lib. For a clean coral board, you can just replace your lib folder at /usr/local/lib with the given /lib folder to implement it.  This system essentially replaces the settup phase found at https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mini-pitft-135x240-color-tft-add-on-for-raspberry-pi/python-setup 

The passive.py program should work after the lib is installed and will confirm the proper instalation of the lib.


*THIS LIB IS CREATED FOR USE WITH THE GOOGLE CORAL BOARD AND IS NOT MEANT TO FUNCTION ON ANY OTHER DEVICE
